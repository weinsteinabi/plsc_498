# Welcome

**Visualizing Social Data**

This course is about:
- Turning data into *arguments*
- Making design choices explicit
- Building figures that survive scrutiny

We will treat visualization as:
- A research method
- A communication tool
- A form of evidence

---

# About Me

I am a faculty member in political science and data science.

My work focuses on:
- Social and political conflict
- Networks, text, and spatial data
- Computational and statistical methods

I care deeply about:
- Reproducible workflows
- Clear communication
- Methods that hold up outside the classroom

---

# Why Visualization Matters

Most audiences:
- Do not read tables
- Do not read methods sections
- Do not read appendices

Figures often carry the entire argument.

That is why we treat them seriously.

# How This Course Is Structured

Each week follows the same rhythm:

**Tuesday**
- Short open-book concept quiz
- Lecture on ideas and design principles
- Short in-class activity

**Thursday**
- Live coding demo
- In-class implementation
- Optional stretch concept if you finish early

Consistency is intentional.

---

# How We Will Code

This is an **R-first course**.

You will learn to:
- Produce figures programmatically
- Re-run analyses end-to-end
- Explain *why* a figure looks the way it does

Code is treated as:
- Part of the argument
- Part of the documentation
- Part of the grade

---

# How Assignments Work

Most work happens **in class**.

You will submit:
- Reproducible code
- Polished figures
- Brief written justifications

Everything is managed via:
- GitHub repositories
- Clear folder structure
- Version control

You are not graded on speed — you are graded on clarity.

---

# Key Course Milestones

You should be aware of three major checkpoints:

- **Midterm (take-home)**  
  Covers two lecture weeks; focused on interpretation and critique

- **Final Project**  
  A small portfolio of figures built around a real dataset

- **Final Presentations**  
  In-class presentation and discussion during the final week

Exact dates are posted on Canvas.

# What This Course Is *Not*

This course is not:
- A software survey
- A cookbook of chart types

We will spend more time on:
- What a figure claims
- What it hides
- How design choices affect interpretation

---

# Expectations

You are expected to:
- Attempt problems before asking for help
- Bring specific questions
- Explain your reasoning

Struggling with code is normal.  
Not engaging with it is not.

---

# Icebreaker

Take one minute and think about:

**What is your favorite movie?**

Then:
- Share your choice
- Be ready to say *why* you picked it

There are no wrong answers.

---

# Looking Ahead

Next class:
- We start working in R
- We set up GitHub repositories
- We establish a reproducible workflow

Bring:
- Your laptop
- Questions when things break (they will)

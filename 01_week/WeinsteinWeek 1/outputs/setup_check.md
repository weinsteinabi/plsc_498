Reflection:

Most of the work I have done with R and GitHub together has been through GitHub 
Desktop, so working with the console and terminal to get it set up was definitely 
a new experience. After setting up Git on my PC though, it wasn't terribly difficult.
I think my biggest concern with this at the moment is being able to push the correct
items to the course repository upon completion.

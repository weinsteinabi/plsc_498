# Visualizing Social Data (PL SC 498)

## Course description
**Visualizing Social Data** is designed for undergraduate students majoring in Social Data Analytics and related disciplines. The primary objective is to introduce students to the tools, principles, and practices for visualizing complex social science data. Students engage with a range of visualization techniques (static and interactive) and apply these methods through hands-on projects.

The course emphasizes:
- effective communication of analytical findings through visual narratives,
- mapping spatial relationships, and
- common challenges faced when visualizing social data.

Students will leave the course prepared to critically assess and clearly convey data-driven insights through compelling visualizations.

## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have an understanding of introductory statistics (equivalent to **PL SC 309** or **STAT 200**) prior to taking this course.

## Repository / folder structure
This repository is organized by week (`01_week`, `02_week`, …). Each weekly folder contains:
- the **problem set** materials,
- the **code** used to build lecture slide decks,
- and any **syllabus outputs** relevant to that week.

**Note:** The **second slide deck** in each week always includes the **code needed to complete the problem set**.

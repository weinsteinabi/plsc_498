# Short Write-Up: Mapping Data to Visual Encodings

For each plot:

1) What question is this plot helping answer?
2) What variables are mapped to what visual properties?
3) What comparison is easiest to make? What is harder?
4) Identify one design choice that is a *default* and explain whether it helps or hurts.

## Optional stretch
- Create a second version of ONE plot optimized for a different audience (e.g., general public vs technical).
- Explain what you changed and why.
